# 📊 Udemy Course Analysis

## 🧩 Project Description
This project analyzes Udemy course data to uncover key trends and insights related to pricing, ratings, enrollments, and course levels. The goal is to understand what factors contribute to higher engagement and success on the Udemy platform, and to visualize these findings through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Online learning platforms like Udemy host thousands of courses, but not all perform equally in terms of enrollments, ratings, and popularity.  
This project aims to answer the following questions:
1. What factors influence course popularity and enrollment?
2. Are there significant differences between free and paid courses?
3. How do course levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) impact engagement?
4. What trends can be observed in course publishing dates?
5. Are there outliers or patterns in pricing, ratings, or enrollments?

## 🔧 Steps in the Project
1. **Data Collection:** Importing the dataset from Kaggle.  
2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates  
   - Converting date and numerical formats  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Distribution of course prices, ratings, and enrollments  
   - Relationship between paid vs free courses  
   - Impact of course level on engagement  
   - Time-based trends in course publishing  
4. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Bar plots, histograms, box plots, heatmaps  
   - Correlation analysis between key variables  
5. **Insights & Interpretation:**  
   - Drawing conclusions from visual trends and statistical summaries

## 💡 Insights Gained
- **Paid vs Free Courses:**  
  Paid courses generally have **higher enrollments and better ratings** than free courses.  
- **Course Levels:**  
  Beginner-level courses attract the **highest number of students**, while Expert-level courses have limited engagement.  
- **Time Trends:**  
  The number of courses published increased **sharply between 2015–2017**, indicating rapid growth in e-learning.  
- **Pricing:**  
  Most courses are priced between **$20–$200**, and price alone doesn’t determine success.  
- **Ratings:**  
  Higher-rated courses tend to have **more enrollments and reviews**, suggesting trust and quality correlation.  

---

## 📈 Future Scope
- Apply **machine learning models** to predict enrollments or ratings based on course attributes.  
- Develop **interactive dashboards** using Power BI, Tableau, or Plotly Dash.  
- Analyze **instructor performance** and their contribution to course success.
